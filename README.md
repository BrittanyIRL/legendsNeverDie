because we lost too many in 2016

Action Items:
1) move #id with keys along page 
- set start 
	-- done 
- set finish 
	-- done 
- when not keydown/keyup make #id float up and down
- set obstacles so that you have to use vertical space too
- when moving forward or backwards speed up background motion(?)
- tilt #id when moving to make better use of "movement" on page

2) finish sequence 
- when move #id to gates end keyup/down ability 
	-- done
- trigger animated keyframe
- after animation is over ask player if they want to guide another legend to heaven

3) intro page
- #id fly in (css) and hover
- pop in and fade out intro text with minimal guidance

4) static items
- social bar on bottom
- footaco in corner with about blurb to pop in/out 
- localstorage on bottom bar declaring legends guided to heaven

5) icebox
- if guided multiple legends to heaven show past legends guided in heaven - like a party
- easter eggs along course that you can click on to do stuff
	-- change background for instance
	-- play a sound snippet
	-- lighting bolt 
- gates open when get close enough
